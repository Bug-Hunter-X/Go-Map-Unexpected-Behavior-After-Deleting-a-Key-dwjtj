# Go Map Unexpected Behavior After Deleting a Key

This repository demonstrates an uncommon edge case in Go's map behavior. After deleting a key from a map, accessing that key again will return the zero value and `false` indicating that the key is not present. However, subsequently assigning a value to that same key will overwrite the previous zero value. This behavior might lead to subtle bugs if not properly understood.

## Bug Description
The main issue lies in how Go maps behave when you access a previously deleted key. While accessing a deleted key correctly returns the zero value and `false`, assigning a new value to it doesn't immediately reflect the "deleted" status, potentially leading to unexpected side-effects.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully checking the return value of `delete()` to ensure the key is correctly removed before making any further assumptions. Alternatively, using a different data structure or logic to manage the map contents may be necessary for specific use cases.
